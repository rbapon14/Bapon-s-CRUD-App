# Bapon-s-CRUD-App

CRUD Application using React and Express.js

# Description of the Project

This is a simple full-stack CRUD application based on React using the Express.js server. Within this application, users will have the capability to create, read, update, and delete data. This backend was designed by using SQLite as the data repository and Express.js as the API request handler. There is a need to allow the usage of CORS - the CORS Middleware to enable cross-origin requests.
